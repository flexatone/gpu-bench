# GPU Setup on Linux

// You might have Nvidia GPU but not have CUDA b/c you are using X.org Nouveau Driver!
// Some systems have a hybrid mode that only uses GPU when needed

// not sure this is necessary
% sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

// got driver installed where UI failed
% sudo apt install nvidia-driver-510 nvidia-dkms-510 nvidia-utils-510

% nvcc --version

# GPU Libaries, Python Development

CuPy
CuDF
PyTorch

Because CuPy is built for different GPU, package requirements are different per hardward
No free CI
No MacOS!


# CuPy

Not developed by NVIDIA
Already has ROCM version available
Implements subset of NumPy API
Does NumPy-like data viewing
Does not support all flags (includying writeable!)


# HyRay

Fall back on CuPy
Not available GPU
Out of memory
Unsupported dtype
